In other words, her system goes from 3:00 to 3:10 over and over and then goes from 3:10 to 3:20 over and over.\n\nI asked if the repetition algorithm was this simple. Sofy explained that it was not, that the timing of the repetition changed based on what was seen, but she declined to draw in this mechanism as the current diagram was the fundamental concept of the piece.\n\nTalking about the drawing and its aesthetics, Sofy explained that she did not draw a computer, projector, or camera, preferring instead the eye and brain for the computer system. She explained that this was because the piece was technology independent, only using a camera and projector because those are currently the best tools to re-project reality. Further, the input-process-output system of the computer conceptually aligns with the input-process-output system of the viewer.\n\nSofy also drew the very initial concept image of the piece, a snake vomiting itself."}]}
